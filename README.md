ðŸ“š Personalized Revision Scheduler
This is a web application built to help students study more effectively using the power of spaced repetition. The app intelligently schedules flashcards for review, personalizes the learning experience with AI, and provides visual insights into study habits.
The project is built entirely in Python using the Streamlit framework, making it a powerful yet simple-to-run web app.
âœ¨ Features
 * Spaced Repetition (SM-2 Algorithm): The core of the app. It dynamically adjusts a card's next review date based on your grading (Again, Hard, Good, Easy) to optimize learning and retention.
 * AI-Powered Flashcard Generation: Using the Gemini API, you can generate multiple flashcard questions from your notes or any text, streamlining the process of creating study materials.
 * Multiple Decks: Organize your flashcards into different subjects or topics. The app supports creating and managing multiple decks for various study needs.
 * Progress Visualization: A dynamic calendar heatmap shows your study streaks and a pie chart visualizes your grading distribution, helping you track your progress at a glance.
 * Data Management: Easily import your flashcards from a CSV file and save your study history locally.
